											<h2>Ambitions, Career and the Future</h2>
											<p>About Me</p>
										</header>
									</header>
									<p>Hi there, my name is Aaron Balkin and I’m 24 years old. I’m an aspiring entrepreneur looking to make it in the IT world. I am from regional Queensland; a small town called Beaudesert. Currently I reside in the Brisbane area where I work as a Patient Support Officer at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital while I complete my studies with RMIT. Alongside my studies and working, I am a family man first. I have a beautiful daughter and a loving partner that I cherish my days off with.
While I have an array of hobbies outside from normal life duties, the one that takes up majority of time is gaming. When most people come home from work and finish their after-work errands, most people tend to turn on Netflix or read a book to wind down from a days work. Instead, I put on my headset and switch on my Xbox and gather my team.
</p>
								<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
								<p>My curiosity for IT first sparked when I was about 6-7 years old when my stepfather at the time was building computers in his spare time. Every afternoon after school I would race home to help him. From there it developed into databases and systems. I have discovered flaws in every system I have worked with in my adult life. Such systems as a Point of Sale system when I worked in retail. If I wanted to view the sales in live data, i.e. by the hour or by the day, I simply couldn’t because it would take 24 hours for such data to populate. My interest in IT is therefore to develop systems that are more efficient and easy to use.

Prior to commencing my studies at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), I began my degree of Bachelor of Business, Information Systems at Swinburne University. While I enjoyed my time with Swinburne, my student advisor recommended transferring my studies to RMIT. I was told that not only would RMIT enhance my studies and study experience, but they could offer me more in my future career as a Business Analyst.

						<!-- Ideal Career -->
							<section id="two">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>Ideal Career</h3>
									<p>My ideal career in the IT environment would be a business analyst (BA for short). A business analyst is someone who facilitates solutions for stakeholders within a business. They are therefore required to work with a diverse group of stakeholders requiring great interpersonal skills and the ability to implement the same solution to different departments within the business. </p>
									<p><img src="images/SBAJOBR.jpg" alt="SBAJOB" style="float:right;width:200x;height:500x;"> Shown on the right is a job advertisement for a senior business analyst <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39893850?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=849a4013-d932-45e6-b94e-ebf9112a5201">(Click here to view the job)</a>. This role is advertised for a financial company requiring the candidate to have experience within the banking industry and an advanced education of business analysis process and practices.
This job advertisement appeals to me because it requires a candidate to have array of skills gathered over time. Skills such as building relationships with all stakeholders; the ability to analyse and interpret business needs; and have experience working in scrum/agile projects.</p> <p>As mentioned above, a business analyst is required to have great interpersonal skills which is used to maintain and build relationships with stakeholders. A business analyst must engage with all stakeholders, each requiring the business analyst to engage differently to each stakeholder to achieve the same goal. Another skill that is derived from experience within the industry is the ability to identify and analyse business needs. As each business has different needs and goals, a business analyst must identify how each process is implemented and how each stakeholder contributes to the business. It is the business analyst’s requirement to know how each process is used and implemented to gather an overall scope of the business. Finally, a requirement of such a role is for the senior business analyst to have experience in scrum projects. A scrum project, as defined by the article ‘Agile Project Management with Scrum’ (Sliger, 2011), is one of the agile methodologies designed to guide teams in the iterative and incremental delivery of a product. Often referred to as “an agile project management framework,” its focus is on the use of an empirical process that allows teams to respond rapidly, efficiently, and effectively to change. Working with a scrum project requires the business analyst to work within a team environment and use different systems and software to achieve the goal.
</p>

									<p>To achieve this ideal career, I would have to begin as an entry level business analyst and familiarise myself with business practices, stakeholders involved and any technological systems utilised within the business. Mentioned above, I would be required to have worked within a scrum project, and would familiarise myself with their software <a href="https://monday.com/?utm_source=adwordsbrand&utm_campaign=au-brand-e-desk&aw_keyword=monday.com&aw_match_type=e&gclid=CjwKCAjwwvfrBRBIEiwA2nFiPT1gQ30bVJmeRZPg5ZK-ZMj2K0m_ZRawHeOsfGjk1OL1kh3TfQF82BoCG9EQAvD_BwE">(such as monday.com)</a>.  The position advertised above requires the candidate to have an Institutional Banking background. After developing more advanced skills working as an entry level business analyst, I would then seek further study in a postgraduate degree in <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/online/online-master-of-commerce">commerce</a> to broaden my knowledge of banking institutes.</p>

						<!-- online test Results -->
							<section id="three">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>To better understand my personality traits and learning style, I conducted three personality tests. I used the 16Personality Test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">(here)</a>, a Learning Style Test from Personality Max <a href="https://personalitymax.com/">(here)</a> and The Big Five Personality Test <a href="https://www.truity.com/">(here)</a>. These three tests revealed some new information to me. The first test; the 16Personality Test is a free version of the Myers-Brigg test. It showed that I am a commander, which they define as a natural born leader. I identify myself as a leader in most group activities, or if I am not a leader I tend to contribute a lot to the activity at hand. The second test; the Learning Style Test surprised me and exhibited that I am a visual learner more than a kinaesthetic learner, meaning I learn by performing tasks. I have always had felt that I learned a lot more from practice rather than being told how to do things. For example, while I was learning how to create this website on GitHub, I watched only a few tutorials and taught myself the rest. The third test; The Big Five Personality Test is a test based on someone’s ability to think in abstract and complex ways. The results didn’t come as a surprise, as the test scored me high as an extravert which I was aware of, however it did score me a 56% on openness where the average is 58%. I had also thought of myself as more of an abstract thinker rather than a concrete thinker as they had suggested. </p>
									<p>Based on the results these tests displayed, in a team, depending who my team mates were, I believe I would prove to be a team leader or someone who contributes greatly to the team. Being a natural leader has both pros and cons. The pros are that I contribute a lot to the team and brainstorm my own and everyone’s ideas. The cons are that I may seem bossy and controlling because I may put my own ideas before others. However, I hope that being an extrovert may dull these moments with the team because the Big Five Personality Test suggests that extraverts actively engage with everyone, which is true for my circumstances</p>
									<p>When forming a team, I need to consider that I am a leader and that I am an extravert. In most situations I am happy to work with anyone, however also don’t want to feel as though I am carrying the team. I define carrying the team as initiating many ideas, feeling as though I am at the forefront of a large portion of the work ad having to follow up other members frequently for input or ideas. When forming a team, I would be looking for like minded extraverts like myself and other leaders.</p>

							<!-- Future Project -->

							<section id="four">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>Project</h3>
									<h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>The project idea I would like to develop is similar to a service already utilised by millions of working-class people around Australia; AfterPay. The difference between this already popular service and my project idea is that instead of encouraging people to spend money, it will be encouraging the working-class to save money. I call this idea Defer “N” Save. The idea is quite simple; instead of paying the price listed on special in major grocery chains, the user would pay full price and have the difference saved in a trust held by Defer “N” Save. The user will have the freedom to withdraw their funds to their nominated bank account whenever they choose.</p>
									<h4>Motivation</h4>
									<p>The motivation for this project idea stemmed from my own personal experiences. I have found that every year multiple bills all roll around at Christmas time. Being financially impaired for Christmas is never an ideal situation for anyone. I found that I was spending more money using services such as AfterPay and credit cards just so I could enjoy Christmas with my family, and catch up with my bills in the New Year. Many Australians like myself are also facing financial difficulties. A survey was conducted to show that one in three Australians borrow money to pay bills (Good Shepperd Microfinance).  After I came to the realisation that I was in financial difficulty, I started researching the banks on how I could save more money. While saving money in a bank account seemed like a good idea at the time, I was still spending what I saved simply because it was available to me in my bank account.</p>
									<h4>Description</h4>
									<p>Defer “N” Save’s goal is to offer an alternative method to saving by allowing the consumer to pay full price for their groceries and have the difference saved in their account for a later time. In the project’s first phase, it will have to have operate as a website or an app on a smart phone. ZipPay is another ‘buy now, pay later’ system. It is usually accepted by most major outlets, however JB HiFi; a leading electronics store will not allow the use of such payment options. ZipPay avoid this by selling JB HiFi gift cards on their website where a customer can use that gift card in store. This allows ZipPay to act as a middleman. I’d like to develop something similar.</p>
									<p>The top two grocery retailers in Australia are currently Coles and Woolworths, who both have an online store where customers shop online and choose to pick up in store or have delivered to their address. Defer “N” Save wants to be that middleman, similar to ZipPay, between those retailers and their customers. Defer “N” Save will appear to operate a separate store on a different website where the products are the same based on the user’s location. The website or app will automatically update by extracting data from the retailers website allowing the customer to purchase updated products at updated prices.</p>
									<p>When a customer chooses to use Defer “N” Save, they will have the exact same list upon checkout as to what their chosen retailer would have on their website. Once the customer has completed their shop, they will be led to the shopping cart page where it will show the full price of the items and how much will be reimbursed into their Defer “N” Save account. If the customer is happy to do so, they purchase their product selecting pick up in store or delivered. Defer “N” Save will then automatically complete the online order for them with their chosen grocery items.</p>
									<h4>Tools and Skills Required</h4>
									<p>To develop a system like Defer “N” Save, we would require tools to maintain the website and the stock listings. One tool to gather the initial pricing data and stock would be a web scraping tool. A web scraping tool is a program that can pull data from specific websites, with most software such as this having the ability to automatically arrange the data into the appropriate information for the website. Another tool and skill required is database management. Database management will be at the core of this project as it needs to be updated regularly and accurately. Poor management of the data will essentially break down the service and render the site useless.</p>
									<h4>Outcome</h4>
									<p>If the project is successful, I believe it will help many Australians for their rainy day needs or just that little extra cash later. The project may seem small for some consumers only save $30 a week but over a year that’s $1,560. For the project Defer “N” Save, it will open many more doors for consumers as it may become a necessity for all stores to have (much like AfterPay) with the potential for other sources of income such as brand deals and data mining.</p>
